# Hello-World
First repository
As an experienced analyst for product and marketing in telecommuniations using Tableau, MS Access, SQL, VBA, and Excel, most of my analytics experience consisted of the the extract-transform-analyse-model-analyse-report workflow that began with a customer request. 
I hadnled the data myself and controled the output.

Recently I shifted roles and have been getting requests for analytics and automated reporting with customer's data from Excel spreadsheets. 
Most customers are not consistent in the way they store this information for example date columns contain text entries like TBC, Q2, 'end of yer' and the like, which makes automation very difficult and impractical.
This drove me to start providing soltuions for capturing the data.

At first I started with simple data validation controls in Excel but then moved into full on MS Access solutions to move users away from spreadsheets and maintain control of the data.
The need for collaboration drove us to use SharePoint lists to store data as the quickest solution using MS Access for the interface and linking of SP tables.
Corporate restrictions and policies make it very difficult to set up 'real' databases and build applications not restricted to desktops. Access to in-house IT resources is almost out of reach (always under resourced and don't take small scale projects very seriously, intra-departmental charges are sooo out-of-touch, and turn-around times stretched too far).

I am very keen on becoming more proficient in building customised end-to-end solutions for customers and minimising workload reliance on external deparments. All this starting with Hello World with GitHub.
